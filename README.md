# CFC Glua Style Guidelines

A set of guidelines to help keep your GLua code Clean and Cool üòé

---

#### If you're a CFC Member or Contributor
This is a set of rules we ask you to follow in our repos.
Your PR will be blocked if you add code that doesn't meet the style guidelines.

#### If you're not part of CFC
Use these however you want! This is a set of guidelines that we believe helps keep your code maintainable and share-able.

If you don't like some of the guidlines, that's fine!
The most important thing by far is **consistency**. If you decide to use or ignore some rules, be sure you do that **everywhere** in your code üëç

#  Spacing
## Spaces around operators

  **Good**
  ```lua
  local x = a * b + c
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  local x = a* b+c
  ```
## Spaces inside parentheses and curly braces if they contain content

  **Good**
  ```lua
  local x = ( 3 * myFunc() ) + 5
  local data = { 5, {} }
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  local x = (3 * myFunc( )) + 5
  local data = {5, { }}
  ```
## Spaces after commas

  **Good**
  ```lua
  myFunc( 10, { 3, 5 } )
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  myFunc( 10,{ 3,5 } )
  ```
## Indentation should be done with 4 spaces

  **Good**
  ```lua
  if cond then
      myFunc()
  end
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  if cond then
    myFunc()
  end
  ```
## No spaces inside square brackets

  **Good**
  ```lua
  local val = tab[5] + tab[3]
  local val2 = tab[5 * 3]
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  local val = tab[ 5 ] + tab[ 3 ]
  local val2 = tab[ 5 * 3 ]
  ```
## Single space after comment operators and before if not at start of line

  **Good**
  ```lua
  -- This is a good comment
  local a = 3 -- This is also good
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  --This comment doesn't have a space before it
  local a = 3-- This comment starts too close to the 3
  ```

---

# Newlines
## Never have more than 2 newlines

  **Good**
  ```lua
  local config = GM.Config


  function GM:Think()
      -- do thing
  end
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  local config = GM.Config



  function GM:Think()
      -- do thing
  end
  ```
## Top level blocks should have either 1 or 2 newlines between them

  **Good**
  ```lua
  local config = GM.Config


  function GM:Think()
      -- do thing
  end
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  local config = GM.Config
  function GM:Think()
      -- do thing
  end
  ```
## Non top level blocks/lines should never have more than 1 newline between them

  **Good**
  ```lua
  function test()
      local a = 3

      print( a )
  end
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  function test()
      local a = 3


      print( a )
  end
  ```
## Returns should have one newline before them unless the codeblock is only one line

  **Good**
  ```lua
  function test()
      local a = 3

      return a
  end

  function test2()
      return 3
  end
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  function test()
      local a = 3
      return a
  end
  ```
## Code should be split into managable chunks using a single new line

  **Good**
  ```lua
  function CFCNotifications.resolveFilter( filter )
      if type( filter ) == "Player" then
          filter = { filter }
      end

      if type( filter ) == "table" then
          filter = fWrap( filter )
      end

      filter = filter or player.GetAll
      local players = filter()

      if type( players ) == "Player" then
          players = { players }
      end

      if not players then players = player.GetAll() end

      return players
  end
  ```

  **Bad, far too dense and difficult to read at a glance**
  ```lua
  function CFCNotifications.resolveFilter( filter )
      if type( filter ) == "Player" then
          filter = { filter }
      end
      if type( filter ) == "table" then
          filter = fWrap( filter )
      end
      filter = filter or player.GetAll
      local players = filter()
      if type( players ) == "Player" then
          players = { players }
      end
      if not players then players = player.GetAll() end
      return players
  end
  ```

# Gmod lua additions
## Do not use GMod operators ( `&&` `||` `!` `!=` )

  **Good**
  ```lua
  if a ~= b and not b then end
  ```

  **Bad, Garry's operators aren't recognized by standard Lua highlighting**
  ```lua
  if a != b && !b then end
  ```
## Do not use GMod style comments ( `/* */` and `//` )

  **Good**
  ```lua
  --[[
    This line does stuff
  ]]
  do( stuff ) -- Stuff being done
  ```

  **Bad, gmod comments aren't recognized by standard Lua highlighting**
  ```lua
  /*
    This line does stuff
  */
  do( stuff ) // Stuff being done
  ```
## The use of continue should be avoided if possible

  **Good**
  ```lua
  for k, v in pairs( tab ) do
      if IsValid( v ) then
          v:Remove()
      end
  end
  ```

  **Bad, garry's `continue` is a flawed implementation that [is prone to errors when used in repeat-until loops](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Specific_Operators)**
  ```lua
  for k, v in pairs( tab ) do
      if not IsValid( v ) then continue end
      v:Remove()
  end
  ```
  
  If your condition is more complicated, consider deferring the logic to another function
  ```lua
  local function processItem( item )
      if not IsValid( item ) then return end
      if not item:IsReady() then return end
      
      item:Process()
  end
  
  for _, item in ipairs( tab ) do
      processItem( item )
  end
  ```

---

# Naming conventions
## Local variables and functions should always be written in camelCase

  **Good**
  ```lua
  local myVariable = 10
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  local MyVariable = 10
  local my_variable = 20
  ```
## Constants should be written in SCREAMING_SNAKE

  **Good**
  ```lua
  CATEGORY_NAME = "nothing"
  local MAXIMUM_VALUE = 25
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  CategoryName = "nothing"
  categoryName = "nothing"
  category_name = "nothing"
  local maximumValue = 25
  ```
## Global variables should be written in PascalCase

  **Good**
  ```lua
  GlobalVariable = 10
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  globalVariable = 20
  global_variable = 20
  ```
## Methods for objects should be written in PascalCase

  **Good**
  ```lua
  function classTable:SetHealth( amount )
  end
  ```

  **Bad**
  ```lua
  function classTable:setHealth( amount )
  end
  ```
## Table keys
### Table keys should only contain `a-z A-Z 0-9` and `\_.` they should not start with `0-9`

  **Good**
  ```lua
  myTable.myValue = 4
  ```

  **Bad, accessing the table value requires brackets and quotes because of the hyphen**
  ```lua
  myTable["my-value"] = 4
  ```
## Use `_` as a variable to "throwaway" values that will not be used

  **Good**
  ```lua
  for _, ply in pairs( player.GetAll() ) do
      local _, shouldKill = ply:GetKillData()

      if shouldKill then
          ply:Kill()
      end
  end
  ```

  **Bad, `k` isn't used**
  ```lua
  for k, ply in pairs( player.GetAll() ) do
      local canKill, shouldKill = ply:GetKillData()

      if shouldKill then
          ply:Kill()
      end
  end
  ```
## Hook naming:
  - Hook identifiers should be named as such `Organization_AddonName_HookPurpose`
  - The hook event name should not be included in the identifier.
    For example, you should not do `ORG_MyAddon_OnDisconnect` or even `ORG_MyAddon_CleanupPropsOnDisconnect`. But`ORG_MyAddon_CleanupProps` would be appropriate. The "HookPurpose" should state what a function does without restating information provided by the event name.
  - Hook event names should be named as such `Organization_EventName`

---

# General
## Quotations
### You may use single or double quotes, but be consistent

  **Good, quote usage is consistent**
  ```lua
  myFunc( "hello ", "world!" )
  ```

  **Bad, different quotes are used interchangeably**
  ```lua
  myFunc( "hello ", 'world!' )
  ```
## Do not use redundant parenthesis

  **Good**
  ```lua
  if x == y then
  ```

  **Bad, these parenthesis are not necessary**
  ```lua
  if ( x == y ) then
  ```
### Redundant parenthesis may be used if it makes the order of operations clear. The author should use their best judgement
  It's important for the author to remember who their target audience is. Not every reader will be good with maths, and it can be helpful to make equations easy to follow

  **Acceptable**
  ```lua
  local amount = ( quantity * modifier ) + baseAmount
  ```
  
  **Unsavory, but fine**
  ```lua
  local amount = quantity * modifier + baseAmount
  ```

## Multiline tables
### Elements should begin on the next line and the last line should contain only a closing bracket. Elements inside should be indented once
  **Good**
  ```lua
  tbl = {
      v1 = c,
      v2 = d,
      v3 = k,
      v4 = j,
      v5 = y
  }
  ```
  
  **Bad, this indentation is inconsistent and can make it difficult for the reader to parse**
  ```lua
  tbl = { v1 = c, v2 = d, v3 = k, v4 = j, v5 = y }
  ```

## Multiline function calls
### Multiline function calls should follow the same guidelines as Multiline tables
  **Good**
  ```lua
  myFunc(
      "First arg",
      secondArg,
      { third, arg }
  )
  ```
  
  **Bad, this indentation is inconsistent and objectively wrong**
  ```lua
  myFunc( "First arg",
      secondArg, { third, arg } )
  ```
## Return early from functions

  **Good**
  ```lua
  function test()
      if not myThing then return end

      -- Do a bunch of real complicated things
  end
  ```

  **Bad, adds an extra level of indentation**
  ```lua
  function test()
      if myThing then
          -- Do a bunch of real complicated things
      end
  end
  ```
## "Magic numbers" should be pulled out into meaningful variables

  **Good**
  ```lua
  local maxX = 25

  function checkX( x )
      return x > maxX
  end
  ```

  **Bad, the significance of `25` is unknown without a meaningful variable name**
  ```lua
  function checkX( x )
      return x > 25
  end
  ```
## Complex expressions should be written on multiple lines with meaningful variable names

  **Good, each step of the equation is named and done individually. The math is easy to follow**
  ```lua
  local widthModifier = amount * damageMult
  local age = 1 - lifetime / duration
  local width = widthModifier * age
  ```

  **Bad, this math is difficult to figure out from a glance**
  ```lua
  local width = ( amount * 5 ) * ( 1 - lifetime / duration )
  ```
## Never use semicolons
### Semicolons provide no functional value in Lua. While they can be used to delimit table items, a comma is preferred

  **Good**
  ```lua
  local a = 3
  print( a )

  return a
  ```

  **Bad, this exclusively makes the code harder to read**
  ```lua
  local a = 3; print( a );

  return a;
  ```
## Make use of existing constants where possible

  **Good**
  ```lua
  x = y * math.pi
  radians = math.rad( deg )
  ```

  **Bad**, the meaning of `3.142` may not be immediately clear. It also suffers a loss in precision compared to `math.pi`**
  ```lua
  x = y * 3.142
  radians = deg * ( 3.142 / 180 )
  ```
## Unnecessarily long conditions should be avoided
### Conditions can be pulled out into meaningful variable names to avoid this

  **Good, each check is clear and it's easy to follow the reasoning**
  ```lua
  local entValid = Isvalid( ent )
  local entOwner = ent:GetCPPIOwner()
  local ownerVehicleIsVisible = entOwner:GetVehicle():GetColor().a > 0
  local ownerCapable = entOwner:IsAdmin() or entOwner.canDoThing

  if entValid and ownerVehicleIsVisible and ownerCapable then
      -- doThing
  end
  ```

  **Bad, the conditions are difficult to follow and require some unpacking**
  ```lua
  if IsValid( ent ) and ent:GetCPPIOwner():GetVehicle():GetColor().a > 0
    and ( ent:GetCPPIOwner():IsAdmin() or ent:GetCPPIOwner().canDoThing ) then
      -- do thing
  end
  ```
## Lines should be around 110 characters long at the most
### This isn't a hard limit, there are plenty of valid exceptions

  **Good**
  ```lua
  if IsValid( ent ) and ent:IsPlayer() and ent:IsAdmin() then
      local hue = ( CurTime() * 10 ) % 360
      local color = HSVToColor( hue, 1, 1 ) )

      ent:SetColor( color )
  end
  ```

  **Bad, this line is too long and could easily be split into multiple, easy-to-follow lines**
  ```lua
  if IsValid( ent ) and ent:IsPlayer() and ent:IsAdmin() then ent:SetColor( HSVToColor( ( CurTime() * 10 ) % 360, 1, 1 ) ) ) end
  ```

---

# Numbers
## Prefer decimals with leading 0s
### While you can omit a zero in decimals in the range of 0-1, it's an antipattern and a one-off exception when compared to decimals outside of said range

**Good**
```lua
local num = 0.69
```

**Bad, while the 0 is implied, it can make it harder to parse at a glance**
```lua
local num = .69
```

## Prefer whole numbers without leading 0s
### Lua numbers can technically be prefixed with as many 0s as you'd like, but in most cases it's completely unnecessary

**Good**
```lua
local factor = 420
```

**Bad, just why?**
```lua
local factor = 00420
```

## Prefer decimals with no trailing 0s
### Except in cases where the trailing 0s make it easier to understand the values (e.g. when you have a column of configurable decimals with varying precision), there is no reason to include them and could confuse the reader

**Good**
```lua
local decimal = 0.2
```

**Bad**
```lua
local decimal = 0.200
```

---

#  Comments
## Do not add useless comments
### Good variable and function names can make comments unecessary. Strive for self commenting code. Save comments for complicated code that may not be clear on its own

  **Good**
  ```lua
  for _, ply in pairs( players ) do
      print( ply )
      if ply:Alive() then ply:Kill() end
  end
  ```

  **Bad, the code explains itself without comments**
  ```lua
  for _, v in pairs( stuff ) do -- loop through players
      print( v ) -- print the player
      if v:Alive() then v:Kill() end -- kill player if player is alive
  end
  ```
